# IDIR
IDIR is a local social system in Ethiopia where people get together and support eachother in times of happiness or sadness. and to be able to do that the collect money monthly or sometimes as it is needed to help out eachother.
And in this project we will try to build an app that will help managing this social system. 

Local Idir managing application based on basic java and database SQL

Goals
1.	The program will try to achieve the ease access of the Idir system which is exercised locally in Ethiopia.
Traditionally the system and all the data are managed through multiple hand-written large record books. Which can lead to repeated data, multiple unnecessary record books which get full every time $ must be replaced with new ones continuously which also may cause loss of data. As well as it is not very efficient for accessing and retrieving any information.
Thus our program will try to overcome these problems. Basically what our program:-
•	Have an interactive GUI that can easily be understood and used by the wide society.
•	Have a database for the data of the members of the Idir and can easily retrieve, manipulate, access and add information in the database
2.	We will try to work on it this summer and finalize it by the end of this year or if takes long as far as meskel. 
And we will use Java for the application program with java swing for the GUI and SQl for the database (probably with MySQL) and also will work on through GitHub for version control and collaboration. 

End Users
The program is designed to be used by many Idirs from small to large based on their respective needs.
The end user are the ones who are at the writing desk of Idir houses who receive monthly payments from members and give compassionate (ማስተዛዘኛ) money for the affected, and for those who manage the Idir’s properties like tents, chairs, tables, etc.
Also the persons who audit, calculate incomes and spending (ሂሣብ ያዥ)
*(other roles in the Idir to be identified)

Plan – Steps 
Back end
i.	Identifying the entities in the Idir system and build based on the relational database model and build everything from identifying entities to making ER-Diagrams to mapping to relational tables (1st week)
ii.	After making the theoretical work of the database then build the database by using SQL in MySQL database management system.
(Which we have to learn from scratch btw) (2nd week)

Front end

iii.Then we start off by building the basic skeletal structure of the application program by using java 
iv.	Identifying what the objects in the GUI of the program do and how the function (3rd week)

Connecting

v.	Connecting the java program with the database making the objects in the GUI function properly and effectively and finalizing. (4th week)
vi.	Testing (5th week)
