# IDIR
IDIR is a local social system in Ethiopia where people get together and support eachother in times of happiness or sadness. and to be able to do that the collect money monthly or sometimes as it is needed to help out eachother.
And in this project we will try to build an app that will help managing this social system. 

Local Idir managing application based on basic java and database SQL

Goals
1.	The program will try to achieve the ease access of the Idir system which is exercised locally in Ethiopia.
Traditionally the system and all the data are managed through multiple hand-written large record books. Which can lead to repeated data, multiple unnecessary record books which get full every time $ must be replaced with new ones continuously which also may cause loss of data. As well as it is not very efficient for accessing and retrieving any information.
Thus our program will try to overcome these problems.

  Basically our program:-
  
    •	Have an interactive GUI that can easily be understood and used by the wide society.
    •	Have a database for the data of the members of the Idir and can easily retrieve, manipulate, access and add information in the database

3.	 we will use Java for the application program with java swing for the GUI and SQl for the database (probably with MySQL).
