IDIR is a local social system in Ethiopia where people unite to provide support during times of joy or sorrow. To facilitate this, members contribute money monthly or as needed. This project aims to create a Java-based app with an SQL database for managing this social system efficiently.

## Goals

Develop a user-friendly program to enhance access to the local IDIR system in Ethiopia. This is a departure from the traditional method of managing data through handwritten record books, which can lead to data duplication, unnecessary record books, and potential data loss. Our program seeks to address these issues.

## Features

By creating the IDIR Management App, our objective is to modernize and simplify the conventional IDIR system in Ethiopia. This should lead to better organization, communication, and support within the IDIR community. Our aspiration is that this app will contribute to a more efficient and effective IDIR experience for all members.
