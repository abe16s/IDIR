#Folder Structure

This folder contains the files and folders needed to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a project.
The folder structure is as follows:

    colored: This folder contains the same images as the dark folder, but colored. These images are used when the buttons are clicked.
    dark: This folder contains the images used for the buttons in their default state. These images are black and white.
